# Healthereum-app
Healthereum facilitates storage of patientâ€™s medical records using blockchain & allows GUI with its Android App & Website. 
I made its Android App with React Native(Expo).
For managing data and navigation in the app Javascript Libraries like Redux and React-Navigation were used.
